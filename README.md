- First thing i noticed is where is Typescript?
- You had a typo in README.md demostrating -> demonstrating
- `npm start` does not start React client, it only start server
- I'm using the same db for tests because of no time
- There is an error in your code. `Jobs.paid` should be init with defaultValue property, not the default.

- I did 4 of 7 endpoints because I ran out of time.
- I'm very eager to see a person who did everyting + tests + react client in three hours.
